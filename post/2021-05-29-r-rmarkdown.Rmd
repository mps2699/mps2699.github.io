## Python or R?

Both languages have their pros and cons, and are better for serving some purposes than others. Python is more of a general language while R specialises in statistical analysis. Coding in python almost feels like texting, whereas R can have a slighly more complicated syntax. The reticulate library in RStudio can let us combine the two languages and help achieve a seamless coding experience. 

Lets try to run some basic commands in both R and python and see what happens.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/local/bin/python")
hi <- "Hello"
hi
```

```{python}
hi="World"
print(r.hi,hi)
```

```{r}
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```

We were able to combine both the R and Python output to get our final answer "Hello World"
